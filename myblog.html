        <h2>My Experience at IIIT Sonepat</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        Back an year ago, when I was preparing for the joint entrance exams,
        IIITs in my mind, always had an image which was of industry based
        colleges where students do tech the whole time and literally nothing
        else. Luckily I had researched well enough about what kind of colleges I
        could get and when I got here I kind of had a rough idea what my life is 
        going to look further like. I remember it was on 13th of August 2024 when 
        my parents and I came here to have a look at the hostels and choose a room 
        for me. I spoke to a few seniors and they told me about the conditions 
        and everything. Gradually I kind of adjusted myself and things started getting
         the way they normally do.
        <br />
        <br>
        You know when they say that
        <i>"Whatever happens, happens for your own good"</i>, I was a firm
        believer in that saying. But even though I had a sheer determination that
        whatever opportunities that are going to unfold in the future, I'd have
        to give my best in them, the first impressions of this college really
        didn't impress me at all. I hoped for a better infrastructure and a lot
        of things. I won't say that I was dissapointed because people graduated 
        from over here were doing good in their life and it was a matter of only
         four years so I could'nt complain a lot.
        <br />
        <br>
        My first month over here was not bad, apart from the fact that I really
        got typhoid and severe health conditions I managed finding like-minded
        people pretty well. I got to know so many things about the human nature
        when I really got close to living with so many people.
        <br />
        <br>
        My roommate was not someone I'd consider did'nt really gave me a good
        first impression, but with time we adjusted and made our way through.
        Also made a lot of freinds in the whole college and was really
        fascinated how some of them were doing so many things to get a better
        career in tech.
        <br />
        <br>
        Ever since I was a kid, I had always dreamt of doing a lot of
        co-curriculars during my college. Mainly due to the fact that I had done
        so much of that from school and did'nt ever wish to miss any
        opportunity. But unfortunately there was'nt much over here. It is also
        quite acceptable since in a college of mere 600 students in total, you
        cannot expect a lot of events happening every now and then.
        <br />
        <br>
        So from there I started wondering that how can I get most out of my
        college. The first semester went and I really did'nt improve in a lot of
        skills which I still regret. A lot of people around me worked pretty
        hard and got good at a ton of things which really promise a good start
        in tech career. I was still stuck between the thoughts of where and how
        should I move forward.
        <br />
        <br>
        So one thing I really liked about IIIT Sonepat was that the seniors over
        here were supportive and very friendly. If you go upto any seniors they
        are ready to help you over anything! But you should help yourself first
        to gather the courage and confidence to speak to them, which I fimd a
        very weird thing about the human nature, most of us just don't want to
        expose ourselves to people for help. I know that everyone has thier own
        insecurities but really, there is nothing bad in seeking support.
