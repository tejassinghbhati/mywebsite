          <b>My Roots: Where It All Began</b>
          <br />
          I was born on 26th December 2006 in Ajmer, Rajasthan.
          <br />
          Nestled in the heart of India, Ajmer is known for its beautiful lakes,
          ancient forts, and soulful energy.
          <br />
          Growing up in Ajmer gave me a strong sense of belonging, community,
          and appreciation for culture â€” values that continue to shape my
          identity and aspirations today.

          <b>Early Education and Childhood</b>
          <br />
          I have completed my schooling from Mayoor School, Ajmer. It is one of
          the most well recognized and elite schools of the city. I had the
          priviledge to be part of various co-curricular as well as academic
          clubs during my school time.
          <br />
          I have also been a district-level handball player. Apart from that I
          always loved engaging in various sports and extra curricular
          activities like debating, street theatre, extempore, quizes and etc
          during my school life.

          <b>Personality</b>
          <br />
          I consider myself as a very friendly and outgoing person. I love to
          travel, meet new people, make new friends, hangout and watch movies
          and webseries. I often love to spent time with my family and it always
          feels like so much support and honour is there to be with them.
          <br />
          I am curious about geopolitics, geography, AI and tech related stuff
          and always keep looking up staying updated on all of this.

          <b>My Hobbies</b>
          <br />
          Genuinly I am that person who doesn't like to study too much at all!
          <br />
          What I really love doing is painting, reading, doing debating
          competitions and cooking! I have done debates, extempores and other
          speaking activities so much all throughout my school every now and
          then and even in college I keep doing debates all across Delhi.
          <br />
          I am glad that I am in the NCR at this time of life because this
          region have something to offer to every kind of person.
          <br />I hope to make the best out of my college experience and it has
          been so well up till now. Some of my paintings, pictures from debates
          and all are there just below!
