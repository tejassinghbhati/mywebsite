        <b>Sports Achievements</b>
        <br />
        I consider playing sports more as a hobby than really getting into
        competitions. Mostly because of the three year lockdown which happened
        during the pandemic years, I couldn't really get ahead from where I
        stood in sports.
        <br />
        Right before the lockdown I have been a district-level Handball Player.
        <br />
        Apart from this I have played various hockey, football and basketball
        inter-house tournaments.
